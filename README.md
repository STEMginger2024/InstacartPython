# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Instacart is a grocery delivery company wanting to increase the effectiveness of their marketing. They want to enhance market segmentation via analysis of grocery basket data in order to deliver more targeted promotions to their customers.

As a data analyst, my role included:
* Loading raw data sets into Jupyter Notebook
* Cleaning and wrangling raw data using Python (pandas, NumPy)
* Merging all three datasets using one common identifier
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Generating insights regarding customer behavior
* Creating data visualizations to support my findings

This project focused on discovering actionable insights to improve market segmentation and drive targeted marketing campaigns. Identified trends included the busiest days of the week and hours of the day for Instacart orders, family profiles based on customer age and number of dependents, regional customer behavior, and more.
